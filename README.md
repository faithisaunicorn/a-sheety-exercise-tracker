# a-sheety-exercise-tracker
{Day 38} 100 Days of Code Python Pro Bootcamp - a Google Sheets-based exercise/calorie tracker

This project made use of Nutritionix to calculate calories burnt for a given exercise (factoring duration/intensity in as well), and Sheety to upload the data directly into a Google Sheet

Despite what the name suggests, this exercise tracker is far from sheety
